# Gaianet Telegram Bot

This repository contains a Telegram bot that answers questions about the Gaianet protocol and its ecosystem using the Gaianet LLM model. The bot fetches relevant documentation, builds a vector database, and responds to user queries based on the data provided by the Gaianet public API.

## Features

- Answers questions about Gaianet's protocol, network, nodes, and more.
- Retrieves relevant documents from Gaianet Docs and builds a vector database using Hugging Face embeddings.
- Integrates with the Gaianet Gemma LLM to provide detailed and accurate responses.
- Supports Markdown formatting in replies and ensures proper Telegram Markdown parsing.
- Includes an inline keyboard for asking more questions and a quick-reply keyboard for common topics.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** version 16 or later
- **Telegram Bot API Token**: Create a bot via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather) and get the API token.
- **Hugging Face API Key**: Obtain your API key from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/abhishekb740/GaianetBot.git
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your environment variables:
    ```bash
    TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY=your-telegram-bot-key
    HF_API_KEY=your-hugging-face-api-key
    ```

4. Build the bot and start it:
    ```bash
    npx tsc
    node bot.js
    ```

## Usage

- After starting the bot, you can interact with it by sending commands or questions.
- Use `/start` to receive a welcome message and instructions on how to ask questions.
- Use `/topics` to get a list of common topics you can ask about.
- The bot will parse your questions, retrieve relevant documents from the Gaianet Docs, and provide responses based on the vector database and Gaianet Gemma LLM.

### Example Commands

- `/start`: Displays the welcome message and provides a link to Gaianet Docs.
- `/topics`: Provides quick-reply buttons for commonly asked topics.

### Markdown Formatting in Telegram

To ensure proper formatting, the bot uses the `telegramify-markdown` package, which automatically escapes any problematic characters in Markdown and makes it safe for Telegram.

## Libraries Used

- **grammy**: A modern and lightweight framework for building Telegram bots.
- **node-fetch**: For making API requests.
- **langchain**: Used for loading documents and performing text splitting for vector search.
- **@langchain/community/embeddings/hf**: Hugging Face embeddings for document vectors.
- **@langchain/vectorstores/memory**: In-memory vector store for storing document embeddings.
- **telegramify-markdown**: A helper to safely convert Markdown into Telegram-safe MarkdownV2 format.
- **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.

## Development

To contribute or make changes, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix.
3. Make your changes and commit them with a descriptive message.
4. Push your branch and create a pull request.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure you have provided the correct API keys in your `.env` file.
- If the bot responds with "Vector store not initialized yet," the document loading or vector creation might not have completed. Wait for the bot to fully initialize before testing it.
- If you encounter a "Bad Request: can't parse entities" error, check if the response text is not properly escaped for Markdown. This is handled automatically by the `telegramify-markdown` package, but certain cases may still arise.
